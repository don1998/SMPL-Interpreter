     * will be called, which allows all the behaviours associated with a 
     * particular activity (e.g. intrepreting or compiling), to be consolidated
     * within the implementation of the Visitor.  The more direct implementation
     * of that activity would require individual methods be spread across all
     * the subclasses of this class, which makes maintenance more tedious.

     * @param state The argument required by the visitor, usually some sort of state
     * @return The result of visiting the subtree rooted at this node, according
     * to the rules implemented by the visitor supplied.
     * @throws FractalException if the visitor encounters a problem while traversing
     * the tree rooted at this node.
